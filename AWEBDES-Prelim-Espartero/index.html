                        So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of <b>design</b> and <b>evolve</b>, something we hope
                        we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography.

                        Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these
                        galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what
                        lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate, we'd love to have you. All
                        galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us
                        what you have in mind.

                            We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'll let everyone know and schedule
                        a meet up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city, <a href="#" class="link-warning dot">let us know!</a>

                            <p class="body-text">
                                Due to the heightened security concerns around the
                                country, it has become common to find photographers
                                routinely challenged when taking photographs in public
                                places. With that in mind, we invite you to join us in a free
                                forum as noted photographer Shea Hansen presents
                                "Photographer's Rights in a Post 9/11 World."<br><br>

                                Shea will discuss what your rights are when taking
                                photos in a public space. Following her talk we'll have an
                                open forum where you can ask questions, compare
                                experiences, and become better informed as to what
                                your responsibilities are as amateur photographers. <br><br>

                                The forum will be held at the Cheek-Chastain Gallery,
                                227 West 29th Street in Manhattan on March 19th as
                                part of their "Engage" lecture series.
